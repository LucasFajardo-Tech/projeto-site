        <p>Hi, I'm Lucas. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm 13 years old and since I was 8, with my father's help, I've been trying to get into the world of programming, starting with "code.org".</p>
        <p>At age 11, through the "Video Course" by Professor Gustavo Guanabara, I started studying programming logic.</p>
        <p>Now, at 13, still using the "Video Course", I'm watching the Git and GitHub course lessons and the first HTML5 module, which helped me create this website.</p>

        <p>I've already mentioned some achievements, or things that are still in progress, but I don't intend to stop here. I dream of one day becoming a good programmer who, with joy in my work, a desire to continue learning, and financial recognition, can create and support a family, providing them (and myself too, haha) with good things to enjoy.</p>
